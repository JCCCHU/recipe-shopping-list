## Description

Zippi List is a shopping list web-app with recipe ingredient lookup functionality. After entering their search, users can view recipes and choose what to add to their recipe cart. When they're done browsing, they can enter 'shopping mode', which turns the full list of ingredients into a checklist. Users can also look up their nearest supermarkets with the store finder function

## Features

* Comprehensive database of recipes by Spoonacular
* Preview recipe ingredients without leaving the page
* Add and delete recipes from the list
* Store finder functionality via Google Maps

## Usage

Start by searching for a recipe you intend to purchase ingredients for. Check the results to identify the best match. If a recipe is identified, add it to the list.

Once all recipes have been added, hit "Go Shopping" to turn the ingredients list into a checklist. 

If there are things you need that weren't present on the original recipes, they can be added here now with the "Add Item to Shopping List" bar at the bottom.

Use the store finder by entering your postal code.
